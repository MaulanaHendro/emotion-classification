# Emotion Classification

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify human emotions based on textual data. By leveraging the dataset provided by Hugging Face, specifically the "dair-ai/emotion" dataset (available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion), we aim to train a robust model capable of understanding and categorizing emotions expressed through text.

To accomplish this task, we employ the TensorFlow library, a widely-used open-source framework for building and training machine learning models. TensorFlow offers a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities that make it well-suited for natural language processing tasks such as emotion classification.
